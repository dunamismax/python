# Python Open Source Project Ideas

## 1. Project: "CodeBin" - A Modern, HTMX-Powered Pastebin

* **Core Concept:** A minimalist and secure web service for sharing code snippets, built with a FastAPI backend and a hyper-dynamic HTMX frontend. It will prioritize simplicity, performance, and security.

* **Key Learning Opportunities:**
  * **FastAPI:** Building a robust, asynchronous API with path parameters (for paste retrieval) and Pydantic-based request bodies (for paste submission).
  * **HTMX:** Mastering zero-javascript frontend development. The form submission, "copy to clipboard" functionality, and display of new pastes will all be handled via HTMX attributes.
  * **Raw SQL & Repository Pattern:** Implementing a repository to handle the `CREATE` and `READ` operations for pastes using `aiosqlite` (for simplicity) or `asyncpg` (for production-grade performance). You will handle generating unique, short URLs for each paste and manage automatic expiration.
  * **Security:** Using Pydantic for strict input validation on the paste content and settings. Implementing server-side syntax highlighting to avoid XSS vulnerabilities common in client-side highlighters.
  * **Testing:** Writing `pytest` unit tests for the API endpoints and repository logic, ensuring paste creation and retrieval work as expected.

* **Architectural Blueprint:**
  * **Backend:** FastAPI application.
  * **Schemas:** Pydantic models for `PasteCreate` (content, language, expiration) and `PasteRead` (content, language, creation\_date).
  * **Repository:** An `AsyncPasteRepository` class with methods like `create_paste` and `get_paste_by_slug`, using parameterized, raw SQL queries.
  * **Frontend:** A single HTML file with templates for the main page and the "paste view" fragment, dynamically updated by HTMX.

## 2. Project: "InsightDash" - A Self-Hosted Personal Analytics Dashboard

* **Core Concept:** A lightweight, self-hostable application for tracking and visualizing personal or small-project time-series data (e.g., daily habits, workout metrics, website traffic, IoT sensor data).

* **Key Learning Opportunities:**
  * **Data-Driven APIs:** Designing FastAPI endpoints specifically for creating, querying, and aggregating data.
  * **Advanced Raw SQL:** Writing complex, parameterized SQL queries for data aggregation (e.g., `GROUP BY`, `AVG`, `SUM`, window functions) to power the visualizations. This is a crucial skill that ORMs often obscure. `asyncpg` is the required choice here.
  * **HTMX & Charting:** Using HTMX to fetch data from the API and dynamically update charts (using a library like Chart.js or ApexCharts, which are easily integrated). The user could change date ranges or data series, and HTMX would handle updating the chart without a page reload.
  * **Background Tasks:** Implementing a mechanism in FastAPI (or a separate scheduled script) to ingest data from external sources periodically.
  * **Database Schema Design:** Carefully designing database tables to efficiently store time-series data.

* **Architectural Blueprint:**
  * **Backend:** FastAPI with routers for `data_ingestion` and `dashboard_api`.
  * **Repository:** A `MetricsRepository` responsible for all database interactions, featuring methods for inserting data points and running complex analytical queries.
  * **Frontend:** An `index.html` file serving as the dashboard. It will contain multiple HTMX-powered components (charts, summary stats) that fetch their data independently.
  * **Charts:** Vanilla CSS and HTML containers that are populated by a small amount of JavaScript glue code, triggered by HTMX events, to render the charts.

## 3. Project: "MaximusForge" - A FastAPI Project Scaffolder

* **Core Concept:** A command-line interface (CLI) tool that generates a new, production-ready FastAPI project structure, pre-configured with all our established best practices.

* **Key Learning Opportunities:**
  * **CLI Development:** Building a sophisticated CLI application using `Typer` or `argparse`.
  * **File System Manipulation:** Using the `pathlib` module to create directories and template files.
  * **Code Generation:** Writing logic to dynamically generate Python files, including populating the file header with the correct filename, date, and project details provided by the user.
  * **Configuration Management:** Generating configuration files like `pyproject.toml` (with `ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest` settings), `.gitignore`, and a basic `Dockerfile`.
  * **Enforcing Standards:** This project is the ultimate expression of our principles, as its entire purpose is to codify and automate our development standards.

* **Architectural Blueprint:**
  * **Core:** A Python package installable via `pip`.
  * **CLI:** A `main.py` entry point using `Typer` to handle commands like `maximusforge new <project_name>`.
  * **Templates:** A `templates/` directory within the package containing Jinja2-style template files for every file that needs to be generated (e.g., `main.py.tpl`, `repository.py.tpl`).
  * **Logic:** A `builder` module that takes user input, processes the templates, and writes the final project structure to the disk.

## 4. Project: "StaticGen" - A Python-Powered Static Site Generator

* **Core Concept:** A tool that transforms a directory of Markdown files into a complete, static HTML website. It will be configured with a simple YAML file and will feature an optional, built-in FastAPI development server for live previews.

* **Key Learning Opportunities:**
  * **Text & File Processing:** Heavy use of `pathlib` for traversing source directories, and libraries like `PyYAML` for configuration and `python-markdown` for converting Markdown to HTML.
  * **Templating Engines:** Using a templating engine like Jinja2 to wrap the generated HTML content in user-defined layouts (e.g., headers, footers, post layouts).
  * **Extensible Design:** Designing the system with a simple plugin architecture in mind. For example, allowing users to write their own Python functions to add custom template filters.
  * **Integrated Tooling:** This is a perfect example of a non-web-app that can still benefit from FastAPI. The included live-preview server would use FastAPI to serve the generated static files and, for a more advanced feature, could use WebSockets to trigger a browser refresh when source files change.

* **Architectural Blueprint:**
  * **CLI:** An `argparse` or `Typer` interface with commands like `staticgen build` and `staticgen serve`.
  * **Core Logic:** A `generator` module that:
        1. Reads `config.yml`.
        2. Finds all Markdown files.
        3. Converts each to HTML.
        4. Applies the appropriate Jinja2 template.
        5. Writes the result to an output directory (`_site/` by convention).
  * **Dev Server:** A `server` module containing a lightweight FastAPI application that serves the `_site/` directory and optionally handles the live-reload logic.
